# Folder Cleanup

This is a small utililty to cleanup files in a folder by achiving them into monthly sub-directorys.

The tool is intended to be run periodically, and is good for cleaning up folders such as ~/Downloads that tend to accumulate files over time

The tool will only archive files (not directories) that have not been modified in the last 7 days and will place them in a folder according to the last month and year that the file was modified
